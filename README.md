Stock price prediction is crucial for financial decision-making, given its potential to influence investment strategies and financial returns. This study addresses advanced machine learning algorithms for predicting stock values, with an emphasis on Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The study uses historical stock data from 2010 to 2016 to analyze the efficacy of various models using measures like R-squared (R²) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The LSTM model performed exceptionally well, with R² values of 0.9966 and 0.9505 for training and test datasets, respectively, and RMSE values of 1.5891 and 1.7816. The Random Forest model performed well, with a R² of 0.9997 in training and 0.9320 in testing, with RMSE values of 0.4941 and 2.0876. Conversely, SVR showed lower performance, with R² scores of 0.9829 and 0.7405 and RMSE values of 3.5421 and 4.0783. This comparative analysis underscores LSTM's superior capability in capturing temporal dependencies, making it a promising approach for accurate stock price forecasting.
